          <p>Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vashistha Pandya, an AI Engineer fueled by a background in robotics and a profound interest in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
          <p>My journey commenced with a fascination for robotics, and over the years, I've transitioned into the vast field of AI. Proficient in C++, Python, and R, I've delved into diverse technologies such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.</p>
          <p>During my academic tenure at Parul University, I actively contributed to impactful projects. From implementing a Wireless Sound Control system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to simulating an Autopilot Car inspired by Sully Chen, I've gained hands-on experience and a solid skill set.</p>
          <p>Lately, my focus has shifted towards Generative AI. Projects like PulsarWave, an ML and NLP-powered tool for extracting key trends from news feeds, showcase my commitment to this evolving domain. Additionally, BlogGPT, where I leveraged Cohere.ai models for web application script generation, and WebSummarizer, an endeavor in automatic web content summarization using SuperAGI, highlight my adaptability and innovation.</p>
          <p>In terms of learning, I recently completed a Machine Learning specialization from Stanford University. Currently enrolled in a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera, I am actively expanding my expertise.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to channel my passion and skills into a role where I can contribute to the forefront of AI innovation, particularly in Generative AI. If you're on the lookout for a dedicated and versatile AI Engineer, let's connect!</p>
